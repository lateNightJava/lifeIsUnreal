# Life Is Unreal

My journey to learning Unreal and C++.  This repo will consist of tutorials I have completed and small projects inspired of said tutorials.  

Links for the tutorials and other info will be included in the README's for each directory.

### Future aspirations for this repo:
* [Post the projects on the web.](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/978170/view.html)
* Write some medium blogs on my journey?

### Beyond the repo
* Make an actual game
